- Title: Find me a bike - LA Metro Bike Share Data Visualization
- Group name: Tribe
- Members: Hsin-Yu Chang(hsinyuch@usc.edu), Ming-Yi Lin(linmingy@usc.edu), Zhao-Yang Song(zhaoyans@usc.edu)

## Slide 2 Intro

- 1O words: A map-based visualization to help shareholders analyze bike usage performance.

## Slide 3,4 Intro: Who is it addressed to, Why it is interesting, original and useful

- Audience: LA metro share bike Shareholders.

- Clean and straightforward: We use a black background LA map as the homepage. Users will get overwhelmed if we showing them text, data, and charts right away. Instead, we create an interactive roadmap to encourage users to deep into the insight themself. 

- We follow the data analysis logic to help users to find and solve their problem easily: 

The green dots represent "how many bikes in the dock" to help 
shareholders get an overall concept of the usages in each station right away. ==> Then there is a scattered network showing the top 5 destinations after hovering the station dot. ==> Users can learn more about this one special station on the dashboard right side. ==> Users can dive into a big-picture analysis on our "Analysis" page where we provide insights about passholder type, ride duration and bike type analysis by years.

## Slide 5 Who did what

- Hsin-Yu Chang: Data analysis and charts including hourly line chart, usage growth chart, etc.
- Ming-Yi Lin: The framework, Homepage map, Destinations Charts, etc.
- Zhao-Yang Song: Map-based charts including yearly performance, etc.


## Slide 4 Data
- We retrieved data from the LA Bikeshare Metro Website (https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/). 
- This is the major dataset we use is [Trip Data]. The data has been refined according to years. We select the trip data from 2017 Q1 to 2019 Q4. 
- To generate the map, we also link two other datasets: [Station Table] and [Station Status].
 

## Slide 5 Research
- Our research was mainly focussed on understanding the already existing visualizations on LA Metro Bikeshare performance and digging into the aspects that we wanted to improve on such that the shareholders can make a quick and informed decision on the bike renew system or other business strategies.

## Slide 9 Design timeline
- Ideation, Dataset, UI Mockup, front end, back end, publishing, feedback and development. We have accomplished the project in 5 phases. 

First we ideated wherein we thought about what to implement and where to get the data from. 

Then we planned what all visualizations to use, based on researching already existing systems and visualizations. 

In the third phase we implemented the front end first and then the back end. 

In the 4th phase we published our project and rendering feedback forms. 

In the last phase tried to improve the system based on the feedbacks acquired.

## Slide 10 Design Consideration
- Cairo wheel: we followed the cairo wheel to maintain balance between all functionalities such as unidimensionality and multidimensionality, abstraction and figuration.

## Slide 11 Technologies used 
- We  used different web technologies for the frontend and backend. Bootstrap is a CSS library which we 
 used which made our website scalable at different resolution and screen size. D3.js is 
what we've learnt in this class and we used it to create visualizations for this website. We used angular framework. Apart from this we used CSS, HTML,Javascript, particles.js and python.

## Slide 12 Color Scheme
- We have used blue color throughout our project so that it would address colour blind people as well. D3 scaleLinear and scaleOrdinal have been used for the visualizations.

## Slide 13 D3 Usage: Maps



## Slide 14 Responsive
- The webiste is responsive and can be accessible from any device.
