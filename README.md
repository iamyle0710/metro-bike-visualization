### TRIBE - Zhaoyang Song, Hsin-Yu Chang and Ming-Yi Lin
### Introduction
Targeted audience : **Metro Bike Institute** <br>
Our purposes : <br>
\- **Quality on Maintaining Metro Bikes**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which stations are high demanding?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; When to refill the bikes to meet the upcoming demand?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; How to tranfer bikes from station to station and maintain the bikes without high depreciation cost? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; How to encourage more users to use metro bikes as their public transportation?
<br>
\- **User Behavior Analysis**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Analyze users when, where and how they rent the metro bikes?

## Our Visualization
* What is the topic?
    - Statistic Visualization of LA Metro Bike Share trip data
* What is the information you plan to present?
* Do you have a story?

## Secret Sauce
\- Visualizing metro bikers' routes around Los Angeles
<br>\- Responsive User Interface: maintainer / marketer /  user mode
<br>\- Drill down details when clicking on certain route

## Our Plan
\- Dataset : [Metro Bike Share Trip Data](https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/]) 
<br>\- Data collected from 2017 Q1 to 2019 Q2
<br>\- Technology : Javascript, D3.js, HTML5, Python 
<br>\- Design plans, building and evaluating : 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Analyze the bike station data.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Set the purpose and goals of our website.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Assign roles to make sure everyone knows their role and tasks.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Create a content strategy that gives the most efficient way to show information.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Design and create a mock-up of what our website should look like.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Develop our website using the technologies mentioned above.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Evaluate based on features testing, interactivity and visualization wheel.
<br>\- Risk : Hard to identify data based on user types since the data doesn't include user id

## How We Work Together?
\- Define the purpose and design ideas together in weekly meetings.
<br> - Explore and analyze the data.
<br> - Assign works and set timeline to finish all tasks.
<br> - Meet weekly to 1. solve technical problems. 2. revise design plan
