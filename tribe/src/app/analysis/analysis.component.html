        We want to analyze the difference of each passholder type. We
        grouped by passholder type and month to get the average riding duration
        time. This analysis also allows users to be able to see whether specific passholder type affects the trip duration.

            People who hold monthly pass or walk-up tend to ride the
        bike for between 10 - 20 minutes on average and people who hold one-day
        pass tend to ride their bikes between 40 - 90 minutes

        We also want to see whether people like to use electric bike over the
        years. The bike type data has been collected since Oct 2018. The chart
        will be able to present the duration between 2018 Oct to 2019 Sep. We
        grouped by bike type and month to get the used times of each bike type.

      <div class='foundings'>
        The usage of electric bike started to grow up since May and people who
        use standard bike tend to decrease through time.
